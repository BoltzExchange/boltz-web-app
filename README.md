# SwapMarket

This is a fork of the official Boltz Web App served at [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/), which allows non-custodial swaps between different layers of Bitcoin. It adds the ability to list independent backend APIs in addition to Boltz's, so that a swap client can find a better deal. 

Any node can now run [boltz-backend](https://github.com/BoltzExchange/boltz-backend) and compete with Boltz at [SwapMarket](https://swapmarket.github.io).

In addition to potentially lower costs, executing Bitcoin swaps via SwapMarket reduces centralization in this domain and helps avert regulatory pressure on Boltz.

## Is this legal?

Boltz's [AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/BoltzExchange/boltz-web-app/blob/main/LICENSE) permits modifying and running its source code as long as it remains public.

## Is this safe?

All the swaps are atomic. Both legs use the same preimage and will either settle or fail together. Your keys never leave your wallet, which makes the exchange non-custodial.

A backend cannot cheat. Invoices and addresses it submits are [validated](https://github.com/SwapMarket/swapmarket.github.io/blob/dbc5ab9684c26cafa4a35ac49f9f2c8475ce5fb3/src/components/AddressInput.tsx#L28) by the frontend before displaying to the user. An evil backend would require cooperation from an evil frontend to bypass these checks. 

Running our frontend as a Github Page makes it verifiably not evil. The code is hosted, built and deployed publicly. Github [attests](https://github.com/SwapMarket/swapmarket.github.io/attestations) build provenance upon deployment. This makes our swaps completely trustless, unlike [Boltz](https://boltz.exchange) itself (unless you self-host their web app).

We don't run a .onion mirror to preserve such code transparency. If you wish to shield your IP address from Github and API backends, you can use any VPN or Tor Browser. 

The web app is static. All your settings, logs and transaction history are stored only in the browser's cookies and cache.

## Onboarding

Nodes aspiring to become swap providers can apply via [email](mailto:swapmarket.wizard996@passinbox.com) or by adding their API details to the [config file](https://github.com/SwapMarket/swapmarket.github.io/blob/main/src/configs/mainnet.json) with a PR. It is obligatory to be contactable and have ample liquidity. 

Consult Boltz's [deployment instructions](https://github.com/BoltzExchange/boltz-backend/blob/master/docs/deployment.md). It is easier to start with the [Testnet mirror](https://swapmarket.github.io/testnet) and your local backend listening on 127.0.0.1.
