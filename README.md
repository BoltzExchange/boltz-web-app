# Boltz Web App

This is the source of the official Boltz Web App served at [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/). It enables **non-custodial** swaps between different Bitcoin layers. You remain in control of your bitcoin, at all times.

We encourage our technical users to check the code and run the web app locally following the instructions below.

## Dependencies

Make sure to have the latest [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) lts installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to manage npm installs: `nvm install --lts`

## Run

Clone the repository, change to the project folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then `npm run mainnet` and `npx serve dist` to bring it up.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and start swapping!
