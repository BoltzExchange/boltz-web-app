# ðŸ–¥ Boltz Web App

Boltz Web App enables **non-custodial** swaps between different Bitcoin layers. You remain in control of your bitcoin through the entire flow of a swap.

We encourage our technical users to check the code and run the web app locally from source following these instructions:

## Dependencies

Make sure to have the latest [Node.js LTS and NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to manage npm installs: `nvm install --lts`

## Run

Clone the repository, change to the project folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then `npm run mainnet` and `npx serve dist` to bring it up.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and start swapping!
